Dataset:https://drive.google.com/file/d/15hHB4a6zlQYam-RkqeBsMaalmR46zrDt/view?usp=drive_link

This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a news article is fake or real. The dataset used contains articles with labels indicating whether they are fake or real.

The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

The steps involved in the project are as follows:

Load the dataset and split it into training and test sets.

Preprocess the text data using techniques such as stemming.

Train a logistic regression model on the training set.

Evaluate the model on the test set.

The model achieved an accuracy of 97.5% on the test set. This means that the model was able to correctly predict whether a news article was fake or real 97.5% of the time.
